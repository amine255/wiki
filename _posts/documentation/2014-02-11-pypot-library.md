PyPot is a library developed in the Poppy-project to make it easy and fast to control custom robots based on dynamixel motors. PyPot has been entirely written in Python to allow for fast development, easy deployment and quick scripting by non-necessary expert developers. 

The serial communication is handled through the standard library and thus allows for rather high performance (10ms sensorimotor loop). It is crossed-platform and has been tested on Linux, Windows and Mac OS. 

This framework provides different level of abstraction corresponding to different types of use from synchronous low-level motor control to high-level primitives such as walking gait.

Don't hesitate to ask us questions about the documentation on the forum.
