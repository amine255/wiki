## Poppy STL files
We took the decision to stop supporting the Poppy Workbench on Grabcad website.
The workbench has been deleted BUT our collaboration CONTINUE.  

We have moved the Grabcad data into a github repository and all the STL schemas are still available on the Grabcad library section:
- The poppy STL "archives" are here: https://grabcad.com/library/poppy-beta-2
- The github (hardware oriented) is here: https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-hardware-beta

Don't hesitate to use the forum to ask questions about this document.
Poppy team.
