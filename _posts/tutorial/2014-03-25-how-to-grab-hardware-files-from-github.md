We have created a document explaing you how to grab the hardware file from the new github repository: 

- [https://forum.poppy-project.org/t/how-to-get-the-poppy-sources-files/](https://forum.poppy-project.org/t/how-to-get-the-poppy-sources-files/)

In fact, we took the decision to stop supporting the Poppy Workbench on Grabcad website.

The workbench has been deleted BUT our collaboration CONTINUE.  

We have moved the Grabcad data into a github repository and all the STL schemas are still available on the Grabcad library section.


From now on, we encourage you to use...

- The github (hardware oriented): [https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-hardware-beta](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-hardware-beta)

- The poppy STL "archives": [https://grabcad.com/library/poppy-beta-2](https://grabcad.com/library/poppy-beta-2)

Don't hesitate to ask us questions about this tutorial (link above).

Poppy team.
