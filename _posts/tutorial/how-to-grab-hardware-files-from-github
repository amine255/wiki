We setup a new collaboration infrastructure and we took the decision to stop supporting the Poppy Workbench on Grabcad website.

The workbench has been deleted BUT our collaboration CONTINUE.  We have moved the Grabcad data into a special github repository, setup a dedicated forum, and all the STL schemas are still available on the Grabcad library section.

From now on, we encourage you to use in prior the wiki portal:
. http://poppy-project.github.io/wiki2,

You will find on this website the Poppy documentation and, direct links to:
. The forum: https://forum.poppy-project.org/
. The github (hardware oriented): https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-hardware-beta
. The poppy STL "archives": https://grabcad.com/library/poppy-beta-2

. The showcase portal http://poppy-project.org,

Last but not least, we have created a document explaing you how to grab the hardware file from the new github repository : https://forum.poppy-project.org/t/how-to-get-the-poppy-sources-files/
